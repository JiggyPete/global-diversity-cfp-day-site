    <h4>This schedule is aimed at being a starting point for our worldwide workshops.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>All suggestions and contributions are welcome, feel free to deviate from this in your workshop. </h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>Please use your own judgement about when to move on with each item. If attendees are engrossed in proposal writing let them continue, if they are struggling for focus bring in the next video/activity.</h4>

  <% if current_user.present? %>
    <h4>Things to bring:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-it notes and pens for the "Caring for your audience" activity</li>
      <li>
        Stickers for name badges. If you could have 2 different colours, one for people that are happy being photographed and one colour for folks that do not want their photograph taken. It'd be great to explain this during registration and the intro.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <% end %>
  <% if current_user.present? %>
    <h4>Things to identify with the team on arrival:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Private room/space for Code of Conduct violation conversations</li>
      <li>Nursing room for new mothers</li>
      <li>Quiet room</li>
      <li>Gender neutral bathroom</li>
    </ul>
    Signage for all, apart from the CoC room, would be brilliant!

          People don't like writing wonderful things about themselves. Ask attendees to pair up and interview each other using the questions in the video and slide deck, then attendees put together a bio for their partner.
          <br/>
          Once that is done, if folks are comfortable, attendees can present/introduce their pair to the group with their new bio!

          We'd like to harness the views of our attendees worldwide during this activity.

          <b>Please ask for attendees to volunteer to be recorded after each section to explain their examples of exclusionary language or behaviour and email these to peter@globaldiversitycfpday.com.</b>

          The aim here is to build a video to be shared in future years AND with tech communities.

          Part 1:
          <br/>
          <br/>
            Split attendees into groups and provide them with post-it's and pens
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ask them to write down examples of exclusionary language and behaviour and post them on the wall.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Next, get the group to discuss "Why" each item is exclusionary and what is a more inclusive thing to say or do.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            With your attendees being a very diverse group this is a great opportunity to learn from everyones lived experience.

          Part 2
          <br/>
          <br/>
            Here you can either ask the attendees in their groups to identify aspects of a talk that should have a content warning.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Ask them to write down examples of sitations whare content warnings are appropriate and post them on the wall.
            <br/>
            <br/>
              Next, get the group to discuss "Why".
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There are some examples in the slide deck as this may be a little trickier than the previous excercise.
