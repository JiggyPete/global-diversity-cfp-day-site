    <h4>This schedule is aimed at being a starting point for our worldwide workshops.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>All suggestions and contributions are welcome, feel free to deviate from this in your workshop. </h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>Please use your own judgement about when to move on with each item. If attendees are engrossed in proposal writing let them continue, if they are struggling for focus bring in the next video/activity.</h4>

    <h4>Things to bring:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-it notes and pens for the "Caring for your audience" activity</li>
      <li>
        Stickers for name badges. If you could have 2 different colours, one for people that are happy being photographed and one colour for folks that do not want their photograph taken. It'd be great to explain this during registration and the intro.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <% end %>
  <% if current_user.present? %>
    <h4>Things to identify with the team on arrival:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Private room/space for Code of Conduct violation conversations</li>
      <li>Nursing room for new mothers</li>
      <li>Quiet room</li>
      <li>Gender neutral bathroom</li>
    </ul>
    Signage for all, apart from the CoC room, would be great!

        We're hoping this will be a collabrative activity.
        <br/>
        People don't like writing about themselves. Ask attendees to pair up and interview each other, then put together a bio for your pair.
        <br/>
        Once that is done, if folks are comfortable, attendees can present/introduce their pair to the group with their new bio!
