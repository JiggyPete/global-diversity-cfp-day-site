  <h2>Why organise a workshop?</h2>
  <p>
    Are you an meetup or conference organiser, speaker, speaker in the making or someone that feels this event is important and has to happen in your city?
  </p>
  <p>
    In that case our aim is to make it as simple as possible for you to organise a workshop as part of Global Diversity CFP Day. Sign up and add the details of your workshop, invite your facilitator and mentors too and all of this will be added to the site after being reviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll give you a schedule, a set of educational videos and activities to make sure you have as little to do as possible and can focus on providing attendees with a great experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is someone already running a workshop in your location?
    <br/>
    Reach out to them and offer to support their efforts. Many hands make light work.
    <br/>
    Global Diversity CFP Day simply would not happen without people coming together to make this event happen.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What will you need to get this moving?
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A warm postive approach to working with newbie speakers from diverse backgrounds and place a great deal of value in the contribution they bring to tech.
    </li>
    <li>
      A venue with a projector and audio
    </li>
    <li>
      An awesome team ðŸŽ‰
      <br/>
      Your team will include a facilitator to introduce the sections of the workshop and mentors (around one mentor for every five attendees) who can advise attendees with their experience of applying to CFPs in the past.
      <br/>
      Representation Matters. When putting together your workshop team, the people involved need to reflect the people we are encouraging to attend.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure you agree with our <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", code_of_conduct_path %> as you will be in charge of enforcing it.
      <br/>
      Mandatory training will be provided, your workshop cannot go ahead unless all of your team undergo this training.
    </li>
    <li>
      A ticketing page, using a service like <a href="https://ti.to" target="blank">ti.to</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" target="blank">eventbrite</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Promote your workshop. You need to be eager to promote your workshop to every tech community within 100 miles of the venue.
      <br/>
      You and your team are the best people to know the tech communities in your location and how to reach out to the folks in these communities.
    </li>
  </ol>
