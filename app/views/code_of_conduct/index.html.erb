<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
  All attendees, workshop organisers, facilitators, mentors and venue staff involved in Global Diversity CFP Day are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
</p>
<p>
  Workshop team members will enforce this code of conduct throughout the event.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  <b>We value the diversity and inclusion of underrepresented and marginalized people in tech.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Be mindful that this will likely be the most diverse group of people that you have been around and can expect to meet people from a wide range of religions, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, nationalities, sexual orientations, body sizes, physical appearance, mental abilities and physical abilities.
</p>
<p>
  Use this as an opportunity to respectfully interact with a diverse group of individuals in a professional and safe environment.
</p>

<p>
  We are all here to learn and grow. This event, being a professional and safe environment, is not the appropriate venue to question individuals on their underrepresented status.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone found to be behaving in any way that makes participants uncomfortable or impedes the intended goals of this event will be in violation of this Code of Conduct and will be ejected from Global Diversity CFP Day.
</p>

<p>
  Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention are all considered harassing behaviour. Any of these will result in the end of the offenders participation in Global Diversity CFP Day.
