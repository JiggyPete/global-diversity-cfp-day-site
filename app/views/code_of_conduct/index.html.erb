    All attendees, workshop organisers, facilitators, mentors and venue staff involved in Global Diversity CFP Day are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
  </p>
  <p>
    Workshop team members will enforce this code of conduct throughout the event.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    <b>We value the diversity and inclusion of underrepresented and marginalized people in tech.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Be mindful that this will likely be the most diverse group of people that you have been around and can expect to meet people from a wide range of religions, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, nationalities, sexual orientations, body sizes, physical appearance, mental abilities and physical abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use this as an opportunity to respectfully interact with a diverse group of individuals in a professional and safe environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are all here to learn and grow. This event, being a professional and safe environment, is not the appropriate venue to question individuals on their underrepresented status.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyone found to be behaving in any way that makes participants uncomfortable or impedes the intended goals of this event will be in violation of this Code of Conduct and will be ejected from Global Diversity CFP Day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwelcome photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention are also considered inappropriate behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your behaviour proves to be harmful to others you will have to be removed from all Global Diversity CFP Day events.

<h2>Issue Log</h2>
<div class="CodeOfConduct__Issue">
<h3>March 2019</h3>
<p>
  One of our mentors has been removed during a workshop for enabling exclusionary language.
</p>
<p>
  We work hard to setup future speakers to give successful talks using inclusive language.
</p>
<p>
  As such, this incident demonstrated the mentors values were not inline with that of Global Diversity CFP Day and they will not participate in future events.
</p>
</div>
<div class="CodeOfConduct__Issue">
<h3>February 2019</h3>
<p>
  We have received reports from the community that one of our workshop organisers behaved in an inappropriate manner out with Global Diversity CFP Day.
 </p>
<p>
  In order to maintain the safety of people from marginalised groups, this organiser will no longer be allowed to participate in any Global Diversity CFP Day events.
</p>
</div>
<div class="CodeOfConduct__Issue">
<h3>January 2019</h3>
<p>
  Thank you to numerous members of the community for reaching out to inform us that an individual publicly considering running a Global Diversity CFP Day workshop, would not provide the safe, inclusive environment our attendees deserve.
</p>
<p>
  We have been in touch with the individual and they will not be participating in any Global Diversity CFP Day events.
</p>
</div>
<div class="CodeOfConduct__Issue">
<h3>September 2018</h3>
<p>
  Having received a number of reports about the inappropriate behaviour of two workshop organisers, outside of Global Diversity CFP Day, they have been banned from participating in any future Global Diversity CFP Day events.
</p>
<p>
  Our workshop organisers are expected to be role models for attendees. Given they are in charge of attendee safety, organisers are held to the highest standard.
</p>
<p>
  We take your safety and trust very seriously.
</p>
<p>
  Our aim is to cultivate a positive, inclusive environment and it is our responsibility to maintain this environment for everyone.
