  <h2>Call For Proposals (CFP)</h2>
  <p>
  Events or conferences looking for speakers start a process called "Call for Proposals". This is an invitation for anyone interested in taking part to submit their idea for a talk or workshop. Proposals are an outline of what you'd like to talk about and helps organisers choose talks for their events.
  </p>
  <p>
  global diversity CFP day is here to help you craft that proposal and reduce any worry you may have when submitting.

    <h2>Subject Matter</h2>
    These sessions have no specific language, framework or process as a focus. Even if your talk isnâ€™t even related to tech we want to support you too! In short, if there is something that you want to shout to the world we're here to help you get there regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities.
