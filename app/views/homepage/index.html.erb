  <h2>Call For Proposals (CFP)</h2>
  <p>
  Events or conferences looking for speakers start a process called "Call for Proposals". This is an invite for anyone interested in taking part to submit their idea for a talk or workshop. Proposals - or plans - are an outline of what you'd like to talk about and helps organisers choose the right talks for their events.
  </p>
  <p>
  The global diversity CFP day is here to help you craft that proposal, and reduce any worry you may have when submitting.

    <h2>2020</h2>
    In 2020 we will host the third edition of Global Diversity CFP Day following the success of the 2019 event where 81 workshops took place!
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2020 there will be numerous workshops hosted around the globe encouraging and advising newbie speakers to put together your very first talk proposal and share your own individual perspective on any subject of interest to people in tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each workshop will have experienced speakers on hand to:
    <ol>
      <li>give you a warm, inclusive welcome in a safe space (check out our <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", code_of_conduct_path %> which all participants must adhere to)</li>
      <li>mentor you with your proposal</li>
      <li>provide speaking advice</li>
      <li>and share their enthusiasm to get you to the stage!</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <br/>

  <p>
    <h2>Subject Matter</h2>
    These workshops have no specific language, framework or process as a focus. Even if your talk isnâ€™t even related to tech we want to hear from you too! In short, if there is something that you want to shout to the world we're here to help you get there regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities.
