  <h3>Thursday 15th February 2018</h3>

  <p>
    On Friday the 2nd of February the clock was ticking ever closer to 11pm (GMT).
  </p>
  <p>
    11pm?
  </p>
  <p>
    11pm, here in the UK, is 10am Saturday in Australia when the Sydney and Melbourne workshops started the first Global Diversity CFP Day!
  </p>
  <p>
    It was an incredible feeling of anticipation and excitement that an event, more than a year in the planning, was so close to starting.
  </p>
  <p>
    This anticipation also came with a very surreal feeling. Having spent a great deal of time organising a worldwide event, it is starting on the other side of the planet and I'm not there. Had all the planning been a dream? Was it really happening?
  </p>
  <p>
    Then pictures started arriving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Venue's were set up.
  </p>
  <br>
  <div class="jumbotron blog--venue-ready"></div>
  <p>
    Then people, yes real people, were arriving having tea, coffee and breakfast!
  </p>
  <br>
  <div class="jumbotron blog--sydney-arrivals"></div>
  <p>
    It
  <br>
  <br>
    really
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
    is
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
    happening!
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Then <%= twitter_link "web_goddess", "Kris" %> and <%= twitter_link "MsAmandaDean", "Amanda" %> opened their resepective workshops!
  </p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    A lump formed in my throat and a few tears too. IT REALLY IS HAPPENING!
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <h3>Then the wave started</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    Brisbane opened
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Perth, Australia
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Singapore
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Mumbai, India
  </p>
  <p>
    Then New Dehli, India
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Kathmandu, Nepal
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Sylhet, Bangladesh
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Cape Town, South Africa
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Accra, Ghana
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Having never paid much attention to timezones as New Year is celebrated at different times around the world I was paying A LOT of attention to timezones now!

  <h3>Where did all of this come from?</h3>
  <p>
    Back in 2016 as part of the <%= link_to "ScotlandCSS", "http://scotlandcss.com" %> and <%= link_to "ScotlandJS", "http://scotlandjs.com" %> CFP, we organised a few workshops 3 weeks prior to CFP closing.
  </p>
  <p>
    We thought "Wouldn't it be good to have one in London, there are lots of people there?" That'd be great. Everyone we asked for help said "Yes!".
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Dublin, Sheffield and Berlin quickly joined in too!
  </p>
  <p>
    These workshops had a HUGE impact on the diversity of the CFP applicants, the final speaking line-up and also the attendees. The full write-up can be found <%= link_to "here", "http://scotlandjs.com/global-diversity-cfp-day/" %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If these workshops had such a great impact in encouraging people to participate and apply to speak why not share it with all tech communities everywhere?
  </p>
  <p>
    And so began an 18 month journey in which everyone kept saying "Yes" to helping make this incredibly positive movement a reality!
